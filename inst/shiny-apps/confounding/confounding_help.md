This app illustrates confounding in the context of regression modeling. For the example given, the exposure of interest is smoking status, and the outcome is diabetes. We can adjust for any hypothesized confounds (e.g., obesity, gender, and age) in our logistic regression model statement. Use the inputs to the left to adjust for the given confound(s), and explore the output to see how controlling for those variables impacts the estimated effect.
