This app shows how sample size, effect size, and significance level affect statistical power in a one-sample proportion test. Effect size here refers to the difference between the null and alternative probabilities. The default alternative hypothesis for a one-sided test is determined to be "> null" or "< null" based on whether the alternative probability is greater or less than the null probability. Check the two-sided option to see how power is affected by the more conservative two-sided alternative.
