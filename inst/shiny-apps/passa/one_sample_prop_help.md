Example: we think people place name tags on the left side of their chest 75% percent of the time versus random chance (50%). What sample size do we need to show this assuming a significance level (Type I error rate) of 0.05 and a desired power of 0.80?

Set the Alternate proportion to 0.75 and the Null Proportion to 0.50. Since our hypothesis is greater than 0.50, we would also set Alternative to 'greater.' However it is common practice and more conservative to assume a 'two-sided' alternative.
