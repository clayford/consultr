Example: we want to randomly sample male and female undergraduate students and ask them if they consume alcohol at least once a week. Our null hypothesis is no difference in the proportion that answer yes. Our alternative hypothesis is that there is a difference (two-sided; one gender has a higher proportion, but we don't know which). We want to detect a difference as small as 5%. How many students do we need to sample in each group if we want 80% power and a significance level of 0.05? Set the Group 1 proportion to, say, 15%, and the Group 2 proportion to 10%.
