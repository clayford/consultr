This app draws 100 random samples of a specified size from a Normal distribution with a specified mean and standard deviation, and then calculates a specified confidence interval (CI). It demonstrates how a CI either does or does not overlap the true value we seek to estimate. We call it a 'confidence' interval because we are confident in this process. For example, calculating 100 95% confidence intervals will result in about 95 of the intervals overlapping the true value. Click the 'Generate new samples' button to see that this is more or less the case. Notice also that changing the size of the sample or the parameters of the Normal distribution have no effect on the process.
